# cub3D_42
This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you’ll have to find your way.

<br>
Wolfenstein 3D is the ancestor of games like Doom (Id Software, 1993), Doom II
(Id Software, 1994), Duke Nukem 3D (3D Realm, 1996) and Quake (Id Software, 1996),
that are additional eternal milestones in the world of video games.

# Goals
<br>
This project’s objectives are similar to all this first year’s objectives: Rigor, use of C, use
of basic algorithms, information research etc.
As a graphic design project, cub3D will enable you to improve your skills in these
areas: windows, colors, events, fill shapes, etc.
To conclude cub3D is a remarkable playground to explore the playful practical applications of mathematics without having to understand the specifics.
With the help of the numerous documents available on the internet, you will use
mathematics as a tool to create elegant and efficient algorithms.
